# Running deployer as a pod for existing OpenShift cluster

## Collect cluster credentials
* Cluster: ...
* OpenShift admin user: `kubeadmin`
* Password: ...

## Login to cluster
```
oc login ... --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

Keep the login command, you will need it later to set the vault secret the deployer will use.

## Create configuration
```
export CONFIG_DIR=./cpd-config && mkdir -p $CONFIG_DIR/config
export STATUS_DIR=./cpd-status && mkdir -p $STATUS_DIR
